# The purpose of this application is to automate the searching of indicators on numerous sources and aggregate the output.

# Class used to call the ThreatGrid API.
# Stores output into a variable to later be called by CSVOutput.
class ThreatGridAPI():
	



# Collects output from the API calls.
class CSVOutput():


# Method used to parse the arguments.
# Only two arguments allowed. 
# -s Identifies a single string to search.
# -S Identifies an ASCII file with a series of strings to search.
# All needs to be OS agnostic.
def argParser():

# Parses a configuration file pulled from the git repo.
# Configuration file contains API keys for the services being called.
# File named keys.conf
def configParser():
	keyfile = "keys.conf"

# Method for handling exceptions.
